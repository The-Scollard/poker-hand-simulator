# poker-hand-simulator

A Poker Hand Simulator I did for a Computer Science class in Grade 12 that tracks poker hands using a graphical display. It creates a hand of five cards, figures out what poker hand (Two of a Kind, Three of a Kind, etc) it corresponds to, and updates the statistics, showing the percentage of poker hands to total hands. Running this program for a long time gets you percentages that are very similar to the actual probabilities for recieving certain hands.
